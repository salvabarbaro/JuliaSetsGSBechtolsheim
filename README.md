Python Script for Julia Sets with two random numbers

This Python script generates Julia sets based on two input numbers. The generated Julia set is saved as a PDF file.

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate the appealing aspects of chaos theory to elementary school students.
- **Usage Context**: Used in an elementary school in Bechtolsheim to introduce chaos theory concepts to kids.
- **Output**: A PDF file named after the user's input is generated, visualizing the Julia set.

## Prerequisites
- **Operating System**: Tested on Debian-Ubuntu OS.
- **Python Version**: 3.10 or later.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed.
2. Install necessary libraries: 
   ```
   pip install numpy
   pip install matplotlib
   ```
3. Clone this repository:

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```
   python3 juliasets.py
   ```
2. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter a name for the output file.
   - Enter two random numbers (preferably within the interval [-1, 1]).

### Example
```
Enter a name for the file: pumaXX
Enter the first number: -0.8
Enter the second number: 0.156
```
This will generate a file named `pumaXX.pdf` in the current directory.

## Output
The script generates a picture of the Julia set and saves it as a PDF file.

## Customization
no limits on that.

## Educational Context
This script was created as a tool to make abstract mathematical concepts more accessible and engaging for elementary school students. Teachers or educators are welcome to use and adapt it for their classrooms.

## Known Issues
None. The script is quite easy and should run an apple / Windows machines as well (not tested)
